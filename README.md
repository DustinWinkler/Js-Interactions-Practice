# Js-Interactions-Practice

This little site was practice for JavaScript-based dynamic interactions.

I made 
1) a bouncy dropdown menu for a basic navbar
2) a basic mobile layout that can "change tabs", displaying a different section of content
3) an image slider that scrolls through images, fading the outgoing image to the left or right based on where it is in the list.
